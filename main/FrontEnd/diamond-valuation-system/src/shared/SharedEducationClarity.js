    question: "What is the best diamond clarity to get?",

      "Though Flawless/Internally Flawless is the highest diamond clarity rating, the best clarity to get is the lowest grade which appears clean to the naked eye, which can be anything from VS1 to, in some cases, as low as SI1 or SI2. Under normal viewing conditions, it’s virtually impossible for the regular person to tell the difference between one of these diamonds and a Flawless diamond.",

    question: "Is SI clarity good for a diamond?",

      "SI clarity diamonds can, in some cases, look as good under normal viewing conditions as a Flawless diamond. Inspect each diamond individually to be sure, as approximately 50% of SI1 diamonds qualify as eye-clean.",

    question: "What clarity sparkles the most?",
    answer:
      "Clarity has little effect on a diamond’s sparkle (or, more accurately, its fire and brilliance). As long as the diamond’s clarity grade is SI2 or higher, there should be no effect on the way it interacts with and reflects light.",
