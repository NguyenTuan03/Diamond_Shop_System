    question: "How important is diamond certification?",
    answer:
      "Diamond certification is essential for any diamond because it verifies and describes what it is you're buying. Without a certificate from a reliable lab, there's no way to know if the diamond you're buying is what the seller claims. A diamond certificate includes details like the cut quality, color grade, carat weight and other characteristics. Having proof for what you're buying is paramount, especially with such a large purchase like a diamond.",

  {
    question: "Does my diamond really need a certificate?",
    answer:
      "Yes, your diamond needs a certificate because, without one, there's no way to know what it is you're actually purchasing. A certificate offers proof of aspects like its carat weight, cut quality, color grade, clarity and more. Without a certificate, you won't even know with certainty if the diamond is real or synthetic.",

    question:
      "What is the difference between a certified and non-certified diamond?",
    answer:
      " A certified diamond has been evaluated by a third-party lab and comes with a certificate, whereas a non-certified diamond does not. Certified diamonds can be better trusted because they’ve been verified by a professional gemologist. With a non-certified diamond, it’s hard to know if aspects like the diamond’s color and cut quality are what the seller claims them to be. That’s why we only recommend certified diamonds from the reputable labs of the GIA and AGS.",

    question:
      "What is the difference between a diamond certificate and a diamond grading report?",
    answer:
      "Nothing! Sometimes you will see a grading lab refer to its reports as a certificate and other labs will refer to it as a grading report. Both provide information about a diamond that has been inspected visually by the gemologist.",
