    question: "What is considered a good size diamond?",
    answer:
      " Anything above 0.75ct (5.8mm for a round diamond) can be considered a good size for a diamond. The ideal size really depends on your budget and your taste. Some people don’t like anything above 0.50ct and for some, a 2ct diamond is too small. It’s also important to take into account more than just size – a large, yet low-quality diamond will look worse than a smaller diamond with better grades in other areas.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much is a .25 carat diamond worth?",
    answer:
      "The best diamond clarity grade is Flawless (FL) clarity. Flawless diamonds are extremely rare, with no internal or external imperfections, even when viewed under intense magnification.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is a 2 carat diamond considered to be big?",
    answer:
      "A 0.25ct diamond will be worth around $400-$600, depending on its other characteristics, such as color, clarity, cut quality, and shape.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is .50 carat diamond too small?",
    answer:
      " A 2 carat diamond is quite a bit above average, and can certainly be considered a big diamond. The average diamond size is in the range of 1.00 and 1.2 carats.",
