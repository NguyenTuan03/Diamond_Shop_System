          Diamond cuts are graded from ‘Excellent’ (or ‘Ideal’) at the top to

          diamonds below ‘Good’ cut quality. Among the 4Cs, cut stands out as

          </LinkCharkaUI>{" "}
          “The addition of a cut grade to the GIA Diamond Grading Report and GIA
          Diamond Dossier for round brilliant diamonds is the result of more
          than 15 years of research and testing, including sophisticated
          computer modeling and ray tracing of more than 38.5 million proportion
          sets.”
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          GIA diamond cutting grades for a round brilliant cut diamond will
          range from Excellent to Poor. Diamond cut grade is based on a number
          of factors including symmetry, polish, brilliance and fire. For the
          most brilliance and beauty, only consider round brilliant cut diamonds
          with an Excellent cut. Ensure the symmetry and polish of the diamond
          are either Excellent or Very Good.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          The reality is that 55% of all round cut diamonds receive an excellent
          cut grade from the GIA. About 25-30% of these “excellent” cut diamonds
          are not recommended. Our consultants review thousands of Excellent cut
          diamonds and find bad specs (depth, table, and angles).
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          That’s why it’s important to look at the cut grade of a diamond on the
          GIA certificate, but to also review the diamond closely yourself or
          ask an expert. You don’t want to end up paying for an Excellent cut
          diamond that’s only mediocre.

          How to Choose the Best Diamond Cuts
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          With most of the 4 C’s of diamonds (the others being clarity, color
          and carat weight), there’s a sweet spot where beauty and value meet
          up.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          To use diamond clarity as an example, there is a point (generally
          around VS1-VS2) where any increase in grade is not going to offer a
          noticeable increase in beauty. To the naked eye, a VS1 or VS2 diamond
          will likely appear clean and flawless.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          Diamond cut, however, is different. It’s the one grade you don’t want
          to compromise on. While middling grades in clarity or color can be
          concealed, and low-carat diamonds can still have a radiant and
          beautiful appearance, a low cut grade is likely to result in a diamond
          that doesn’t dazzle like it is supposed to.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg" m={"0 0 20px 0"}>
          We recommend you restrict your search to only Excellent or Ideal cut
          grades, as there is no hiding a below-average cut. Even if your budget
          forces you to sacrifice in other areas, a well-cut diamond should
          still have the potential to stand out.

          is about as perfect a cut as you can get. The depth, table and all
          other proportions are as exact as can be. Because of that, you are
          paying a higher price for the diamond, even compared to a typical
          excellent cut diamond.

        <Text fontSize="lg">
          If the diamond’s facets (the glossy flat surfaces of a diamond) are
          proportional, for instance, they refract and reflect light back to the
          eye in tremendous fashion. Diamonds that aren’t as precisely cut have
          facets and pavilions that do not refract and reflect light as
          spectacularly.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          The amount of light return and brilliance found in an exceptionally
          cut diamond is worth the extra price. Without brilliance and fire, a
          diamond is less than radiant—no matter the carat weight or table size.

        <Text fontSize="lg">
          In other words, a diamond’s cut is the quality that most significantly
          impacts its beauty. That’s why the cost of diamonds with higher cut
          grades are worth every penny—and it’s better to spend more on cut than
          on diamond color or clarity.

          To further understand the factors impacting diamond cut quality, let’s
          examine a diamond’s proportions, primarily its table, width and depth.
          These elements are universally measured and are excellent indicators

          Diamond cut proportions directly affect a diamond’s ability to reflect
          light and provide brilliance. Proportions are based on the ratios

          combinations of these elements impact how the diamond will interact
          with light, which determines its overall beauty and lasting appeal (as

          A diamond’s width is determined by measuring from one end of its

          girdle.

        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          Length to width ratio is measured by dividing the length of the

          Depth % refers to the height of the diamond, from the culet to the top

          dividing the depth by the width, the depth % is achieved.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg" m={"0 0 20px 0"}>
          As an example, if a diamond is 4mm in depth and 4.5 mm in width, the

          Shallow Diamond Cut

          While shallow cut diamonds may seem largely based on their table size

          diamond below the girdle that reaches to the culet) is also made up of
          facets. Round brilliant cut diamonds have 58 facets in total.

          The size, placement and symmetry of the facets impact how well the
          diamond refracts and reflects light. A diamond with unproportioned
          facets, too many facets or fewer facets, can cause a less than ideal
          diamond.

          Brilliance
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          A diamond’s brilliance is the brightness of the white light
          reflection. When looking at a diamond face-up under light, it should
          reflect an abundance of white light. A diamond that’s not symmetrical,
          is cut too deep or too shallow, for example, looks dull instead of
          brilliant.

          Fire
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          A diamond’s fire is the amount of colored light that reflects off of
          the table and facets. Well-cut diamonds not only have brilliance but
          fire too. When looking at the diamond face-up under light—especially
          daylight—you should see colored light bouncing off of the diamond. If
          the diamond doesn’t exhibit colored light reflection, the diamond has
          a low amount of fire.

          Scintillation
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          Scintillation of a diamond refers to the flashes of sparkle when light
          moves on the diamond’s table and facets. The scattering of light
          resembles a sparkle and is caused by the light and dark areas on the
          diamond’s surface. A diamond with a large amount of scintillation is
          more desirable. A diamond without much scintillation can appear dull.

          Finishing details
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          The finishing details are the craftsmanship of the diamond and include
          its permanent treatment and polishing. The polish of a diamond refers
          to the condition and quality of the facet surfaces. A diamond that is
          polished well creates a clear mirror for light to reflect off of. A
          diamond with a poor polish job looks dull because the facets don’t
          reflect light as vividly.

          Factors for Determining Diamond Cut Quality
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          Because diamond cut is an enormous element in determining the beauty
          and brilliance of any diamond, there are some complexities. Many
          factors play a role in how a diamond’s cut quality is determined.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          The main factors impacting diamond cut quality are:
        </Text>
        <UnorderedList m={"10px 0 20px 50px"} spacing={2} fontSize={"lg"}>
          <ListItem>
            <strong>Proportions</strong>: the ratios and sizes of the diamond’s
            depth, width and table
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            <strong>Symmetry</strong>: precision of the facets, mirrors, windows
            and steps
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            <strong>Polish</strong>: the shine and glow of the diamond surface
          </ListItem>
        </UnorderedList>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          When you’re looking to see how well-cut diamonds are, take note of how
          their facets and angles reflect light. Specifically, note how bright
          and sparkly the light return is when placed under a normal lamp.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          You’ll want to gauge diamonds’ fire (the rainbow light of reflection)
          and brilliance (colorless light and sparkle of the diamond). Be sure
          to also watch for any dark spots within the piece.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          When a diamond is poorly cut (even if it has a high color or clarity
          grade), light will not reflect as well back to your eyes, making it a
          duller, more lifeless diamond.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          Be sure to review the GIA cut grade on a diamond’s report, which will
          include ratings of Poor, Good, Very Good or Excellent.

          What’s the difference between Diamond Cut and Diamond Shape?
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          The terms diamond cut and diamond shapes have distinct meanings.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          Diamond shape describes the outline or figure of the diamond. For
          example, pear, oval and round brilliant refer to the shape appearance
          of the diamond.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          Cut refers to the facets, symmetry, dimensions and reflective
          qualities of the diamond. Pear-shaped diamonds, for instance, may be
          cut shallow or deep, dull or brilliant. The heart shape remains, while
          the cut may differ significantly. The finer the cut, the greater the
          brilliance and fire of the diamond.

          Is an Ideal cut diamond better then Excellent?
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          For round brilliant diamonds the GIA assigns a rating of Excellent as
          it’s highest cut grade and AGS uses the term Ideal. Most online
          retailers have adopted the use Ideal when referring to a diamond that
          meet either the highest level GIA or AGS standard.

          What cut is best for diamonds?
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          For round brilliant diamonds the Ideal cut is considered the highest
          rating. Only 3% of diamonds are given the GIA Ideal rating. So called
          Super Ideal diamonds are cut to a higher standard than either GIA or
          AGS highest cut ratings.

          Is diamond clarity more important then cut?
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          A diamond’s cut is ultimately more important than its clarity or
          color, particularly when it comes to brilliance. Before looking at
          color or clarity, limit your search to excellent or ideal cut diamonds
          only.
