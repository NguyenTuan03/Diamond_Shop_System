            What Is Diamond Certification?
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize="lg">
            Diamond certificates, or grading reports, are issued by accredited
            gemological laboratories, such as the Gemological Institute of
            America (GIA). The diamond certificates contain information and
            grades for each of a diamonds characteristics based on the 4Cs -{" "}

          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            Along with each diamond you're considering, you should receive and
            review its lab certification. This lab report or certificate will be
            issued by a grading entity and describes various elements of the
            diamond, such as color, clarity, length and width. Trained
            professionals evaluate, scrutinize and measure the diamonds using
            professional tools, such as a loupe or microscope.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            Each entity grades and describes diamonds differently—and sometimes
            the difference is significant. Several lab entities exist and it's
            important to know which ones are trustworthy and reliable, and which
            ones are not.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            Because diamond certificates are not created equal, the price and
            value of diamonds are not comparable across varying certifications.
            Ensure that you purchase a diamond with a certificate from a highly
            reputable grading entity—and that you review the diamond closely
            before purchase.

          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            When it comes to comparing lab grading entities, it's more important
            to watch for consistency than the strictness of grading.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            For example, the GIA will not grade a diamond the same way the IGI
            rates a diamond. The reliability of the color and clarity grades—and
            in some instances the cut grades—is only as good as the certifying
            lab's reputation. But if one lab consistently gives a single clarity
            grade higher than another lab, that lab is by no means less
            “authentic.”

            Diamond Grading Report is similar to house deeds or vehicle
            registrations in that it offers information on your purchase, and
            this information can be used to determine the value of the
            purchase.”
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            Rather than simply comparing grades between certifications, look for
            consistency within the entity's grading decisions.

            Diamond grading is subjective
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            All diamond grading is subjective—and contrary to popular
            belief—there is not a central organization that mathematically
            defines what a “G” color is or what an “SI1” clarity looks like.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            If one lab consistently calls one color grade “G” while another lab
            will consistently calls that same color “H”, it's perfectly
            acceptable and reasonable—as long as they do so consistently.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            It's important to note that even when an entity is consistent in its
            grading, it doesn't necessarily mean the entity is reliable and
            trustworthy. Buying a diamond with a weak certificate at a high
            price point is not prudent—even if the entity consistently grades
            diamonds this way—because you are not getting the value for the
            price you're paying.

          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            Regardless of the certificate you receive, the price of the diamond
            should be heavily evaluated. The price should reflect the actual
            quality, beauty and Cut of the diamond—both on the certificate and
            to the naked eye.

          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            Every lab has its quirks. Some are looser in grading diamond
            clarity, while others are looser in rating color. Some labs will
            always upgrade specific color ranges, while others favor particular
            arrangements of inclusions.

          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            Smart diamond companies use this knowledge—gained from sending
            thousands of diamonds to different labs each month—to maximize their
            results. Knowing which labs are trustworthy and consistent will help
            you avoid purchasing a diamond worth much less than what the
            certificate is stating to be true.

          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            The AGS (American Gem Society) prides itself on being the original
            lab to provide diamond cut grades. Long before the GIA introduced
            their cut grade a few years ago, the AGS has been offering its
            unique cut grade scale from 0 to 9 (with 0 being termed “ideal”).

          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>

            ). A diamond couldn't be called “ideal” unless it has an AGS
            certificate claiming so. Now that the GIA has entered the cut grade
            game, though, their share in this market has dropped significantly.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            The AGS generally tries to bill itself as being a bit more fancy and

          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            The one issue to look out for is “upgrade shopping”. No lab is 100%
            accurate as color and clarity are not objective grades (like weight
            and dimensions are). If there is a diamond that is somewhere in
            between grades, a manufacturer or retailer may send the diamond to
            multiple laboratories looking for the better grade. For example, say
            a diamond is a weak I color or strong J color, and they received a J
            color from GIA. The wholesaler/retailer may try sending it to AGS
            for the I color (they can then sell it for much more money). Its far
            more likely that the grades will be the same, but its possible they
            will get the upgrade (which more than makes up for the cost of
            sending it to AGS for certification).
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            It is very common for companies to use AGS for branded super ideal
            diamonds (like True Hearts, or Hearts on Fire). But AGS is not as
            commonly used for non-round diamonds. So if a retailer has 50
            cushion cut diamonds, 49 of which are GIA certified and one AGS
            diamond, that diamond is likely to have received an upgrade.

            This is not a knock on AGS, merely an observation of how some
            wholesalers and retailers may try to take advantage of the end
            consumer. All in all, AGS is a very reliable laboratory. We only

            While IGI bills itself as a top-of-the-line laboratory, this is
            unfortunately not the case. From extensive experience in the diamond

              “The most reliable diamond certificates (also called diamond
              reports) come from the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) and
              the American Gem Society (AGS). These are the most respected labs,
              known for their accuracy and professionalism. These reports are
              not appraisals and do not carry valuations. Certificates from any
              other sources are often questionable and should not be relied upon
              by insurers.”

            Buying a diamond with an independent certificate should give you
            peace of mind, knowing your diamond is equivalent to the quality and
            value that is claimed. With our years of expertise, we do not
            believe IGI certificates provide this assurance.

            4. EGL Certification
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            The EGL (European Gemological Laboratory)—vastly and
            inconsistently—inflates their quality claims. When considering an
            EGL certified diamond, you may think you’re getting a better deal.
            In reality, the price is highly inflated for an inferior product.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            We unfortunately have seen many customers purchase an EGL certified
            diamond thinking they found a great deal, only to realize they fell
            for a selling trick
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            As an example of one of these selling tricks, we found an EGL
            certified 1.00 Carat H VS1 ideal cut online for $4,450. At first, it
            seems like an incredible deal. In reality, though, when EGL claims
            it's an H VS1, 50% of the time it's actually a J SI1—and 50% of the
            time it's a J SI2 or K SI1: not an H VS1.

            Searching for a GIA certified diamond two or three Color grades

              The bottom line is: don't buy an EGL certified diamond.

            No matter how “cheap” it seems to you compared to GIA certified
            diamonds, it's all a game.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            Any EGL certified stone in the market is, by definition, more
            expensive than its identical self as certified by the GIA.

          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            As evidence, we sent in the same four diamonds to EGL to receive
            Color and Clarity gradings — the most subjective scales.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            It's evident that the EGL graded the diamonds higher than the other
            labs. An EGL graded diamond with a Clarity of VS2, for example, it
            is not comparable to a VS2 given by the GIA. For this reason, the
            price and value of a EGL diamond is incomparable and inequivalent to
            a diamond certified by GIA.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            In addition, the two EGL labs that graded these diamonds offered
            different results. The inconsistency among the labs makes it
            difficult to trust the grading and verify the actual quality and
            value of an EGL diamond.

            5. HRD Certification
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            HRD (Hoge Raad voor Diamant) is a diamond grading organization based
            in Europe. Not generally regarded as a legitimate alternative in the
            United States, HRD still claims to be the authority for diamond
            grading in the world.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            Over the years, we have experienced incredible inconsistency with
            HRD grading. They usually average about two Color and/or Clarity
            grades above the GIA’s grading. HRD graded diamonds are usually
            priced much higher than equivalent diamonds graded by the GIA. This
            allows for significant profits to be made by diamond companies.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            To offer a comparison between HRD grading and other labs, we sent
            four stones to various lab entities. In the chart below, you can see
            HRD graded the same four diamonds better than the GIA in the
            categories of Color and Clarity: two highly subjective grades.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            The clear difference between the grading demonstrates that it's not
            prudent to compare apples to apples among lab entities. Simply put,
            an F Color grading given by HRD will not mean the same as a GIA F
            Color diamond. The price you'll pay for an HRD diamond will not
            compare to the value and quality of a GIA graded diamond—even if
            it's a grade or two higher
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            <strong>
              If you are considering an HRD certified diamond, we suggest
              reconsidering
            </strong>
            . We recommend only purchasing diamonds that come with a GIA or AGS
            certificate.

            6. GSI Certification
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            The GSI (Gemological Science International) is a new grading entity
            that's only been around for a few years. Unfortunately they didn't
            come to the industry with fresh ideas or innovative technology.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            We have found that GSI grading is not only looser than the gold
            standards (GIA and AGSL labs), but weaker than than the next level
            down (IGI and HRD) as well. GSI also doesn't maintain consistent
            gradings, to try, for example, adjusting the grades down 1 or 2
            qualities and calculating the value.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            For these reasons, we do not recommend buying a diamond that has a
            GSI certificate.{" "}
            <strong>
              We strongly encourage only buying diamonds that have a GIA or AGS
              certificate.
            </strong>{" "}
            By doing so, you actually know what you're getting and you can
            compare apples to apples. Retailers don't use inaccurate
            certificates like GSI in order to give the consumer a better deal;
            they do it to make more money off of those consumers.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            To demonstrate how GSI grades diamonds compared to other labs, we
            sent four stones to GSI, IGI, HRD, EGL and GIA. For the Color and
            Clarity grades—the two most subjective categories—we received
            distinctly different results.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"lg"}>
            GSI graded some of the diamonds higher than the GIA and some lower,
            making it hard to determine the consistency of a GSI grading. When
            looking for a diamond, it’s critical to chose a diamond certified by
            a reliable, consistent entity, like the GIA, so you know that what
            you are buying matches the actual value of the stone.
