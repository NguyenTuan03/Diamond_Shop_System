              significantly impacts its price. Always ensure that the diamond

              this guarantees you're paying a fair price for its actual quality.

            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              Diamond certificates, or grading reports, are issued by accredited
              gemological laboratories, such as the Gemological Institute of
              America (GIA). The diamond certificates contain information and
              grades for each of a diamonds characteristics based on the 4Cs -{" "}

              Along with each diamond you're considering, you should receive and
              review its lab certification. This lab report or certificate will
              be issued by a grading entity and describes various elements of
              the diamond, such as color, clarity, length and width. Trained
              professionals evaluate, scrutinize and measure the diamonds using
              professional tools, such as a loupe or microscope.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              Each entity grades and describes diamonds differently—and
              sometimes the difference is significant. Several lab entities
              exist and it's important to know which ones are trustworthy and
              reliable, and which ones are not.
            </Text>
            <Text fontSize={normalText}>
              Because diamond certificates are not created equal, the price and
              value of diamonds are not comparable across varying
              certifications. Ensure that you purchase a diamond with a
              certificate from a highly reputable grading entity—and that you
              review the diamond closely before purchase.

              rates a diamond. The reliability of the color and clarity

              The AGS (American Gem Society) prides itself on being the original
              lab to provide diamond cut grades. Long before the GIA introduced
              their cut grade a few years ago, the AGS has been offering its
              unique cut grade scale from 0 to 9 (with 0 being termed “ideal”).

              The one issue to look out for is “upgrade shopping”. No lab is
              100% accurate as color and clarity are not objective grades (like
              weight and dimensions are). If there is a diamond that is
              somewhere in between grades, a manufacturer or retailer may send
              the diamond to multiple laboratories looking for the better grade.
              For example, say a diamond is a weak I color or strong J color,
              and they received a J color from GIA. The wholesaler/retailer may
              try sending it to AGS for the I color (they can then sell it for
              much more money). Its far more likely that the grades will be the
              same, but its possible they will get the upgrade (which more than
              makes up for the cost of sending it to AGS for certification).

              It is very common for companies to use AGS for branded super ideal
              diamonds (like True Hearts, or Hearts on Fire). But AGS is not as
              commonly used for non-round diamonds. So if a retailer has 50
              cushion cut diamonds, 49 of which are GIA certified and one AGS
              diamond, that diamond is likely to have received an upgrade.

              The GSI (Gemological Science International) is a new grading
              entity that's only been around for a few years. Unfortunately they
              didn't come to the industry with fresh ideas or innovative
              technology.

              We have found that GSI grading is not only looser than the gold
              standards (GIA and AGSL labs), but weaker than than the next level
              down (IGI and HRD) as well. GSI also doesn't maintain consistent
              gradings, to try, for example, adjusting the grades down 1 or 2
              qualities and calculating the value.

              By doing so, you actually know what you're getting and you can
              compare apples to apples. Retailers don't use inaccurate
              certificates like GSI in order to give the consumer a better deal;
              they do it to make more money off of those consumers.

              To demonstrate how GSI grades diamonds compared to other labs, we
              sent four stones to GSI, IGI, HRD, EGL and GIA. For the Color and
              Clarity grades—the two most subjective categories—we received
              distinctly different results.

              GSI graded some of the diamonds higher than the GIA and some
              lower, making it hard to determine the consistency of a GSI
              grading. When looking for a diamond, it’s critical to chose a
              diamond certified by a reliable, consistent entity, like the GIA,
              so you know that what you are buying matches the actual value of
              the stone.
