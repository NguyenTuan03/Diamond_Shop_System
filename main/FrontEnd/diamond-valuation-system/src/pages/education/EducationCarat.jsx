          Carat, one a diamond's 4cs, describes the weight, not the size of a
          diamond. Diamond carats have a weight equivalent of 0.20 grams. So a
          one-carat diamond is 0.20 grams, and a five-carat diamond is one gram.
          The carat weight plays no role in determining the beauty and sparkle
          of a diamond.

          What is a Diamond Carat Size?
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          According to Wikipedia, the term diamond carat comes from the Greek
          word meaning “fruit of the carob tree.”
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          But you should understand that carat is actually a measurement of
          weight, not size.{" "}
          <strong>One carat is equal to 0.2 grams, or 200 milligrams.</strong>{" "}
          So diamond carat size is something of a misnomer, as a diamond's carat
          doesn't tell you exactly how big or small it is - though there is a
          correlation. As{" "}

            GIA

          , the worlds leading diamond grading lab, says “carat weight seems
          like a straightforward measurement, but there is more to it than a
          simple number”.
        </Text>
        <Image src="https://www.diamonds.pro/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/carat-weight.png" />
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          In ancient times, the seeds of the carob pod were used as standards
          for weight measurements, since the size of their seeds were almost
          always identical. This provided a natural standard of measurement.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          In 1907 at the Fourth General Conference on Weights and Measures, it
          was agreed that a modern diamond carat should equal precisely 200
          milligrams. This is technically known as a metric carat, and is the
          standard diamond carat weight that is used universally today.

          Why Does Diamond Carat Size Matter?
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          The truth is, it doesn’t matter. Think about it. When you look at a
          diamond set in a ring, what does your eye see? Does your eye see
          weight, or does your eye see physical size? Obviously, your eye can
          only see physical dimensions—light doesn’t carry weight information
          back to your eye.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          And if you think about it even more, your eye also doesn’t see the
          total physical size of the diamond, because most of it will be covered
          in jewelry. All you can really see when you look at a diamond is the
          size of its surface area on the top of the diamond, as displayed above
          in our diamond carat size chart.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          However, carat weight is important when it comes to the diamond price.

          Even though this article is about carat size, eye-cleanliness is an
          important part of picking out a diamond. In our opinion, a consumer’s
          goal should be to find the cheapest (in regards to clarity; other
          factors matter as well) “eye-clean” diamond you can find. We use
          “eye-clean” to describe diamonds that may have inclusions if you look
          at them with a magnifying glass (or microscope or loupe), but the
          typical person can’t see the inclusion with their naked eye.

          Carat and Diameter Correlation
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          Now, obviously, there is a direct correlation between the diamond
          carat weight and the diameter of a diamond. It’s mathematically
          impossible for a 0.05ct diamond to have more surface area than a 1
          carat diamond.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          But because cut qualities can vary greatly, there is a vast amount of

          In my experience at Leo Schachter, a 1 carat diamond ring can have a

          Do Lab Diamonds Weight the Same As Natural Diamonds?
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          Yes, lab-grown diamonds weigh the same, and are measured the same in
          terms of weight, as natural or Earth-grown diamonds.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          Lab diamonds are exactly the same, chemically and physically, as
          diamonds formed naturally in the Earth. They are graded the same way
          as well, across the 4 C’s, which includes carat weight.

          That means everything in this article, such as how carat weight
          translated to actual carat size, applies to diamond sizes for both
          lab-grown and natural diamonds.

          What is considered a good size diamond?
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          Anything above 0.75ct (5.8mm for a round diamond) can be considered a
          good size for a diamond. The ideal size really depends on your budget
          and your taste. Some people don’t like anything above 0.50ct and for
          some, a 2ct diamond is too small. It’s also important to take into
          account more than just size – a large, yet low-quality diamond will
          look worse than a smaller diamond with better grades in other areas.

        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">

          other characteristics, such as color, clarity, cut quality, and shape.

          Is a 2 carat diamond considered to be big?
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          A 2 carat diamond is quite a bit above average, and can certainly be
          considered a big diamond. The average diamond size is in the range of
          1.00 and 1.2 carats.

          Is .50 carat diamond too small?
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          A 0.50 carat diamond is below average, but that doesn’t mean it’s too
          small. A half carat diamond can still look beautiful in an engagement
          ring, assuming it’s well-cut and has good grades in color and clarity.

          Need Help Choosing The Right Diamond Size?
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          So as you can see, while weight, as one of the 4 C’s of diamonds,
          should matter to you because it will help determine how much you are
          going to pay, what you should really be focusing on is the diamond cut
          and diameter.
