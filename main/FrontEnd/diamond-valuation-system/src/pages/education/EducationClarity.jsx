          Diamond clarity refers to the grade given to a diamond based on the
          imperfections and inclusions found in a diamond. The fewer inclusions
          and blemishes a diamond has, the higher grade it will receive on the
          diamond clarity chart. The clarity can have a significant impact on a
          diamond’s cost (it’s one of the diamond 4Cs – the main characteristics
          of a diamond). However, many imperfections that affect a diamond’s
          clarity grade aren’t visible to the naked or unaided eye.

          explain how you can use clarity to get the best bang for your buck

          The Diamond Clarity Chart That Actually Matters
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          While it’s true that you need to understand the GIA clarity scale
          (diamond prices are calculated in large part due to their clarity
          grade),{" "}

            what you need to know is how to find an eye-clean diamond

          Those percentages are based on your typical one carat diamonds. So you
          are best off looking for a diamond in the VS2 – SI2 range when
          purchasing a one carat diamond. It’s true that the overwhelming
          majority of SI2 diamonds will not be eye-clean, but who cares? You
          aren’t buying all the SI2 diamonds, you are picking out the one for
          you.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          As diamonds get larger, the inclusions get larger as well. You’ll find
          that it’s harder to find an eye-clean 2 carat SI2 diamond than it is
          to find a one carat. It’s a bit of an art form to pick a diamond based
          off of the videos on James Allen or Blue Nile (or other reputable
          online retailers), so feel free to contact us and we’ll help you find
          the perfect diamond. Everyone on our team has picked out thousands of
          diamonds for our readers.

        <Text fontSize="lg">
          If you are looking at the diamond in a physical retailer, be sure to
          walk around the store and see if you can find the inclusions in
          different lighting scenarios. Some inclusions will be hidden by the
          sparkle under the perfect lighting at the desk, then you’ll be sitting
          in your kitchen and notice a black mark. Once you see it, that is all
          you’ll ever see when looking at your diamond.

          What is the GIA Diamond Clarity Scale?
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          To provide shoppers with an understanding of each diamond’s clarity
          level, grading institutes like the Gemological Institute Of America
          (GIA) use diamond clarity charts to judge diamonds based on their
          appearance and give each stone a clarity grade within a given scale.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          Diamond clarity scales range from I (meaning “included”) to FL
          (meaning “flawless”). Each clarity grade has subgrades that provide
          more information about the visibility of inclusions in the diamond.

          The Best Clarity Grade vs. The Best Clarity Grade for You
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          When educating yourself about diamonds, it’s easy to get lost in the
          technical details. You may end up asking a question and receiving a
          technically correct answer, but it will result in you making a bad
          choice when purchasing a diamond. “What is the best clarity grade for
          a diamond” is a perfect example of this.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          The answer to that question is seemingly simple. A Flawless (FL)
          diamond clarity grade is the highest possible grade a diamond can
          receive. Since it’s the best grade, you should try to get one with
          that grade (or as close to it as possible), right? WRONG!
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          In many ways a diamond clarity grade is meaningless. We’ll explain all
          the technical parameters regarding clarity below, but the most
          important factor is this: Can you see the inclusions with your naked
          eye (without a magnifying glass or microscope) once the diamond is
          mounted in the ring? Everything else (with a few exceptions) is just
          noise.

          How Are Clarity Grades Determined?
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          Natural diamonds are formed in the earth’s mantle layer at a depth
          ranging between 80-120 miles, and they face extreme heat up to 2,200
          degrees Fahrenheit. While their growth takes between one billion to
          three billion years, only the rarest diamonds emerge in perfect
          condition. Most often they are imperfect and contain varying amounts
          of internal inclusions and surface blemishes.

          Five factors play a significant role in how a diamond is graded, and
          how its “score” on the diamond clarity chart is determined. These five
          roles in diamond grading include size, nature, number, location, and
          the relief of the inclusions.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          <strong>1. Size</strong> – The size of the inclusions in a diamond is
          one of the most important factors in determining its clarity grade.
          The bigger the inclusions, the larger the impact they’ll have on a
          diamond’s appearance.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          <strong>2. Nature</strong> – Nature refers to the type of inclusions
          that can be seen in the diamond, as well as the depth of these
          inclusions within the diamond.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          <strong>3. Number</strong> – Grading entities also take into account
          the number of inclusions within a diamond. If a diamond has a large
          number of inclusions, even if small, they can have a large impact on
          its appearance and clarity.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          <strong>4. Location</strong> – The location of an inclusion refers to
          where on the diamond the inclusion is located. If the inclusion is
          situated in closer proximity to the center of the table, then the
          inclusion is more visible to the eye and the clarity grade will be
          impacted much more.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          <strong>5. Relief</strong> – The relief is referring to how noticeable
          the inclusions are in comparison with the diamond — put simply, how
          much contrast there is between the diamond and the inclusions. The
          higher the relief, the darker the color may seem which can affect
          diamond grading.

        <Text fontSize="lg">
          Although the term inclusion is often used to refer to any type of
          imperfection in a diamond, there are several different types of
          inclusions that can affect a diamond’s appearance.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          Here are some of the most common types of inclusions and the effect
          each type can have on a diamond’s clarity:
        </Text>
        <UnorderedList fontSize={"lg"} spacing={2} m={"0 0 20px 50px"}>
          <ListItem>
            <strong>Cloud</strong> – A cloud isn’t one imperfection in a diamond
            — instead, it’s a group of very small pinpoints that are clustered
            together. Clouds can affect a diamond’s brilliance by giving it a
            dull, hazy look. If there are lots of large clouds within a diamond,
            we call it a cloudy diamond.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            <strong>Graining</strong> – Graining is a type of internal inclusion
            that develops because of irregular crystal growth. When a diamond
            has graining, it will show white, colored, or reflective internal
            lines that give the diamond a very hazy appearance.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            <strong>Cavity</strong> –Cavities are surface dents or cracks in a
            diamond. They can appear colorless or colored based on the type of
            minerals that exist within the body of the diamond. If the crystal
            inclusions of the cavity are colored, they will then be much more
            obvious in appearance and can most likely be seen with the unaided
            eye.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            <strong>Feather</strong> – Feathers are small cracks that, as their
            name suggests, have a feathery look when viewed from certain angles.
            Some feathers are obvious, while others are barely noticeable. When
            a diamond has feathers, they can either appear clear or capture
            light and give off a white appearance.

          Top 3 Buying Tips For Diamond Clarity
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg" m="0 0 20px 0">
          Before purchasing a diamond, there are a few things to keep in mind to
          get the best value and beauty, especially when it comes to clarity.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg" fontWeight={"bold"}>
          1. DON’T OVERPAY
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          It’s very easy to overpay for clarity. In most cases, a VS1 or VS2
          diamond will be eye-clean just like an FL diamond, but cost far less.
          Instead of focusing on a certain clarity grade, choose the lowest
          clarity grade that still presents an eye-clean diamond. Your budget is
          better spent on factors that more greatly impact a diamond’s beauty,
          like the quality of a diamond cut.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg" fontWeight={"bold"}>
          2. AIM FOR THE BEST DIAMOND CLARITY
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          The best clarity grade depends on the shape of your diamond. As we
          mentioned above, some diamond shapes are much better at hiding
          inclusions and other imperfections than others.

          3. REVIEW THE DIAMOND CLOSELY
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          Besides looking at the certificate and clarity plot, carefully review
          the diamond to look for visible inclusions. Online vendors,
          particularly James Allen and Blue Nile, have high-end photography for
          just this purpose.
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          Look to see if you notice any blemishes or inclusions. If you do
          notice some, take note of where they are on the diamond. Are they in
          the middle of the table, where they’ll be visible, or near the edge of
          the diamond, where they could be covered up by the setting?
        </Text>
        <Text fontSize="lg">
          The main goal is to find a diamond that’s eye-clean without
          overpaying. If you’re not sure, get an expert’s opinion.
