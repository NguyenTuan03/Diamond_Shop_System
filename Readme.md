> **How to use git command** \
>\
> Pull the project to your computer, run this command in **Terminal**:\
> `git clone https://github.com/NguyenTuan03/Diamond_Shop_System.git`\
>\
>Create a new branch, do your task and push it in your branch:
>1. `git branch <branch-name>` *// If the branch-name hasn't existed, else create a new branch*
>2. `git checkout -b <branch-name>` *// Go to your branch before start coding*
>3. `git add .`
>4. `git commit -m "..."`
>5. `git push origin <branch-name>` *// After finish coding, push your code to your branch*
><!-- end of the list -->
>Merge your branch to main branch:
>1. `git checkout main`
>2. `git merge <branch-name`
><!-- end of the list -->
>Rollback your previous version
>- `git log` *// view previous versions*
>- `git checkout <commit-id>`

>\
>The Anatomy of a Commit Message:
>- **Basic**: `git commit -m <message>`
>- **Detailed**: `git commit -m <title> -m <description>`
><!-- end of the list -->
>Commit type:
>- **feat**: a new feature is introduced with the changes
>- **fix**: a bug fix has occurred
>- **chore**: changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies)
>- **refactor**: refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
>- **docs**: updates to documentation such as a the README or other markdown files
>- **style**: changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on.
>- **test**: including new or correcting previous tests
>- **perf**: performance improvements
>- **ci**: continuous integration related
>- **build**: changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
>- **revert**: reverts a previous commit
><!-- end of the list -->
>Good commits:
>- feat: improve performance with lazy load implementation for images
>- chore: update npm dependency to latest version
>- Fix bug preventing users from submitting the subscribe form
>- Update incorrect client phone number within footer body per client request
><!-- end of the list -->
>Bad commits:
>- fixed bug on landing page
>- Changed style
>- oops
